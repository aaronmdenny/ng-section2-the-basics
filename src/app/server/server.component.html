    String interpolation syntax is:
        {{ <typeScript variable/expression that resolves to a string> }}

    You could, for example, use a method call that returns a string, ternary expression, variable, or string.

    The serverId variable is of type number, but it can be converted to a string.

    Directives that do not modify the structure of the DOM are attribute directives. These directives do not have 
    the * prefixed on them.

    "ngStyle" is a built-in directive that requires some configuration. It allows us to dynamically change CSS
    styles.

    We use property binding on the ngStyle directive to configure it.

    The square brackets around ngStyle are not part of its name. The name of the directive is simply ngStyle.

    The square brackets indicate that we want to bind to some property on this directive. This property's name is
    also ngStyle.

        selector: '[ngStyle]'
        
        ...
        ngStyle = { <some object with settings> }
    
    So, what we are doing here is binding to the property of the ngStyle directive that is also named ngStyle.

    The config object can take the form:
        { 'background-color': 'red' }
    or:
        { backGroundColor: 'red' }

    Since this is typescript inside of the double-quotation marks, we can call a method, as we do below.

<!--
    ngClass allows us to dynamically add/remove CSS classes.

    It also works as intended by using property binding. There is a property within the directive that has the same
    name as the selector.

    ngClass configuration also occurs with a Javascript object's key-value pairs.

    The keys are the CSS class names.

    The values are the conditions that determine whether the class should be applied or not.

    Format:
        { className: <condition> }
    or:
        { 'class-name': <condition> }
    
    If the class name is not camelcase, as with "class-name", surround it with single quotes to make it a valid key.

    You can outsource the condition to a method and call that method in the value.

    {{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}
