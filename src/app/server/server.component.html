<!--
    String interpolation syntax is:
        {{ <typeScript variable/expression that resolves to a string> }}

    You could, for example, use a method call that returns a string, ternary expression, variable, or string.

    The serverId variable is of type number, but it can be converted to a string.
-->
<p>{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}</p>
