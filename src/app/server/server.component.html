    String interpolation syntax is:
        {{ <typeScript variable/expression that resolves to a string> }}

    You could, for example, use a method call that returns a string, ternary expression, variable, or string.

    The serverId variable is of type number, but it can be converted to a string.

    Directives that do not modify the structure of the DOM are attribute directives. These directives do not have 
    the * prefixed on them.

    "ngStyle" is a built-in directive that requires some configuration.

    We use property binding on the ngStyle directive to configure it.

    The square brackets around ngStyle are not part of its name. The name of the directive is simply ngStyle.

    The square brackets indicate that we want to bind to some property on this directive. This property's name is
    also ngStyle.

        selector: '[ngStyle]'
        
        ...
        ngStyle = { <some object with settings> }
    
    So, what we are doing here is binding to the property of the ngStyle directive that is also named ngStyle.

    The config object can take the form:
        { 'background-color': 'red' }
    or:
        { backGroundColor: 'red' }

    Since this is typescript inside of the double-quotation marks, we can call a method, as we do below.
-->
<p [ngStyle]="{ backgroundColor: getColor() }">{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}</p>
